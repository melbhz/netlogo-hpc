# Improving speed, scale and scope of models for improved real-world decision-making

This repo provides the working copy of our submission to SSC. We strive to drive usability of this work by providing editable copies
of all documents and ask that you cite us if this is helpful in your research as follows:

TODO:Include citation for article here.

Please remember to follow the copyrights included in all documents and scripts during any reproduction. Feel free to email us with any 
concerns.
The key steps for users to take this repo and extend it for their work is as follows:

1) Forward a copy of "workflow.docx" file to their HPC infrastructure administrators, and ask them to adapt it to your HPC.
2) Use the modified "workflow.docx" file adapted by your HPC infrastructure administrators.
3) Run our main COVID script and verify that the results are equivalent (we provide the output of our script to verify this).
4) Adapt the scripts to your needs.

For a more detailed overiew of the workflow, please navigate to the workflow folder (on GitHub) or read "workflow.docx".

In our experience, we found that HPC admins are very pro-active at responding to enabling HPC based research (especially for COVID-
related research).

  
If you use the COVID model provided please cite it as follows:
