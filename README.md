This repo provides the working copy of our submission to SSC.

The key steps for users to take this repo and extend it for their work is as follows:

1) Forward a copy of ".doc" file to their HPC infrastructure administrators, and ask them to adapt it to your HPC.
2) Use the modified ".doc" file adapted by your HPC infrastructure administrators.
3) Run our main COVID script and verify that the results are equivalent (we provide the output of our script to verify this).
4) Adapt the scripts to your needs.

In our experience, we found that HPC admins are very pro-active at responding to enabling HPC based research (especially for COVID-
related research).
