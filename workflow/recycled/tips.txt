- do not request more than one node for one job - it won't work - it may just work on one node, and even slower than allocated to one node only
- do not set too large threads - for example thread 40 for 8 core is slower than thread 8 for 8 core
- more cpu core for one job is faster - for example 24 core 24 thread - not three times of 8 core but two times - but it will take very long to get resources because 24 core for one node is not easily available for 32 core nodes.
